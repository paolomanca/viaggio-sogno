PREREQUISITES: a MySQL server is running and set up with the information provided in jdbcConnectionPool-2.PNG screenshot

1) Configure the jdbc connection pool and glassfish realm as showed in the screenshots provided in the "Configuration screenshots folder"
2) Create a new schema in the MySQL database called traveldreamdb
3) Deploy the EAR through the Glassfish web administration console (this should create all of the necessary tables in the database)
3a) Alternatively deploy the application from the Eclipse workspace, after importing the EAR file
4) Select the database schema traveldreamdb through the MySQL shell ("use traveldreamdb;")
5) Execute the SQL script file initDB.sql on the MySQL database ("source /path/to/TravelDream/initDB.sql")
4a/5a) Execute the script through the MySQL workbench

6) Go to http://localhost:8080/Viaggio-Sogno/ to access the website
7) You can login as an employee with username "emp@e.e" and password "emp"
7a) You can login as a customer with username "cust@c.c" and password "cust"

WARNING: unregistering the last employee will prevent you from creating more from the web interface (we decided to prevent registration of employees through the web). In fact only a logged employee can register another employee. If you happen to remove the last employee you can either: insert one manually in the database (be careful since an idpool is required also) or start the process all over from step 1 after undeploying the web application (this method is the easiest).
